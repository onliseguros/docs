Welcome to this documentation.

Our APIs itself was developed to cover the aspects of the digital distribution of insurance products. From now on, 
you are going to be presented with some of our integrations and services. You will be introduced to some of the core concepts 
of the insurance market, and how it works in a highly distributed and technological scope.

With any questions, please feel free to ask in our Developer Support channel, and may contribute to our FAQ. 
You can also suggest minor updates to this documentation at GitHub.
