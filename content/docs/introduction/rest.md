Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. 
It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows 
these guidelines is called RESTful. 

Such a Web service must provide its Web resources in a textual 
representation and allow them to be read and modified with a stateless protocol and a predefined set 
of operations. <a href='https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification'>Learn more</a>
