# Introduction

Welcome to this documentation.

The API itself was developed to cover the aspects of the digital distribution of insurance products.
From now on, you are going to be presented with some of our integrations and services.
You will be introduced to some of the core concepts of the insurance market, and how it works in a highly distributed and technological scope.

With any questions, please feel free to ask in our Developer Support channel, and may contribute to our FAQ.
You can also suggest minor updates to this documentation at <a href='https://github.com/onliseguros/docs'>GitHub</a>.

## About the Platform

The platform brings new technological visions, where it focuses on the optimization of processes and reduction
of manual work following the latest and safest trends in the market. In the Project, we aim at adhering to
processes linked to the legacy system platform with external channels for handling and digital insurance management,
maintaining good market practices, technologies used for mass control, and providing multiple relationship channels
for partners and direct customers.

## OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and
computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation,
or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service
with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming,
the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

## REST APIs

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive
applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful. Such a Web service must provide its Web resources
in a textual representation and allow them to be read and modified with a stateless protocol and a predefined set of operations.
